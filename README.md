## Overview
Programming bootcamps require persistence, focus, and dedication. Participants of these programs
also need one another. This application exists to connect up and coming devs at Code Fellows
to connect with one another and post comments on a group blog page. 

At this point in the project, only logged in users can access the user's pages. Only logged
in users can post to their own page. Logged in users can see blog posts from every user
on their respective pages, but logged in users can only post to their own pages.

## Running program
There are two options for running this application: <br/> 
1. Open the project in IntelliJ and run the CodeFellowshipApplication class.
2. Type this command into the terminal: ./gradlew bootRun
